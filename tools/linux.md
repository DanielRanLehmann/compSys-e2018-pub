# Linux tools -- Roll Your Own Toolchain on Linux

If you prefer to not have to deal with the VirtualBox, here is a conservative list of the software you'll need for this course:

  * [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [wBinutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)". On Debian/Ubuntu you get these with the build-essential package. On Arch Linux/Antergos this is called base-devel.
  * [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/). In most package managers this is called gdb.

### Mounting remote filesystem
You can use sshfs to mount drives over ssh.
