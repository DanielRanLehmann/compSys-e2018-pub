#VM image

For some things it might be easier (or necessary) to use a virtual machine.
http://topps.diku.dk/compsys/compsys17-debian-v1.1-64bit.ova

The VM has the following credentials:
login: neumann
password: hamster

## Connection
After importing the VM, we recommend that you connect to it via ssh:
hostname: localhost
port: 1339

In this dir there are scripts that can help you connect from Linux og OS X. You would need to make them executable using chmod.
