Last lecture you were introduced to the usage of bits and integer representation. This day we will build on to of this by investigating how to do arithmetic with integers and do floating point numbers.

For the lecture I will start using blended learning and flipped classroom. For my own experience also, I will start slowly with a couple of video lectures and later also extend with more questionnaires and online tools.

Katrine Kaas from KU's *Online and Blended Learning* group have been so kind to write text introducing you to the background. [Blended Learning and Flipped Classroom.](https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/28624/pages/blended-learning-and-flipped-classroom)

* 13:15 - 15:00 Exercises
  * These exercises will recap material on Boolean arithmetic and representation of integers.
  * You will also work with addition of binary numbers
* 15:15 - 17:00
  * We can discuss any topic relating to the A0.
  * We will discuss the material on binary addition and discuss open questions.
    * This you are expected to prepare in advance.
    * You can find a video I made about it here: https://youtu.be/IDVwWLVcx0s
    * I will post another video about multiplication Sunday evening
  * We will also talk about floating point numbers and properties of its arithmetic.
  * If time permits, I will touch into the memory structure, otherwise that is a topic for Wednesday.
