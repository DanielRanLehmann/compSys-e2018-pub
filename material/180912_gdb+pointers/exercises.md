# Exercises for 10/9-2017

These exercises will to give you the first experience
with using GDB. As preparation to the following lecture.

---

## Play with GDB
Take some of the programs from last weeks exercises or perhaps even the assignment and play around with GDB. Recreate a bug that you had in your program and try finding it with GDB.
Test most of the commands on the [GDB QUICK REFERENCE sheet](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/refcard.pdf.gz).

## Debug some programs
[Attached](exercise_code/) there is a list of programs containing some different bugs. Some of them very obvious. Use GDB to identify and profile the bugs. Record your approach in a GDB script.

We recommend to investigate in the following order:

* `hello.c`
* `table.c`
* `capitalize.c`
* `array.c`

## Play floating points
Integers are by now way too easy. Don't miss the [Floating point game](https://games.onlineta.org/floating-point.html).
